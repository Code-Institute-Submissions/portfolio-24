# Milestone Project One
## Personal Portfolio

>Welcome to my first milestone project! For this project I chose to create a personal portfolio. My reasoning for this selection is based
on the fact that I can use this project to come back to as I progress through the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) and display
my work in the "Projects" section of this page.

>After researching full stack developer portfolios online (Google and YouTube), I noticed almost all developers implement a single page
design. I personally like this design and chose to follow what seems to be the "norm" in this category.

## Description

---------------
## UX
Being a front end development, UX was extremely important. Easy access to information via easy to find links, as well as creating a relaxed, yet professional design was possibly
the most important feature of this project. Below I will discuss more in detail about specific UX features and design elements which allowed me to achieve the design I wanted
to create.

### Logo
As branding is such a huge part of sales and promotion, I wanted to create a simple, yet professional looking logo to keep this logo specific to this particular page the two 
forward slashes are the same color as the main theme color (R:240, G:95, B:64).
